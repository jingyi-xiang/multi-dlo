# TrackDLO+

TrackDLO+ is an occlusion-robust algorithm for tracking multiple deformable linear objects simultaneously, which I developed for my undergraudate thesis at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (thesis advisor: Timothy Bretl). It is built upon my previous work [TrackDLO](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/assets/pdf/trackdlo.pdf).

Demo:

More detailed documentation will be added when I actually finish writing my thesis in a month or so.
